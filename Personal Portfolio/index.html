        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Originally from Iowa, I joined the Navy in 2012 and served for 10 years, and 
                counting, as an Electricians Mate onboard submarines since 2014. I served for 
                6 years on the USS Alabama (Roll Tide) and am now on my shore duty. I will have 
                11 years of naval service under my belt at my End of Active Obligated Service 
                (EAOS) April of 2023
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my coding journey in 2020 while taking some collage classes
                while I was in the Navy. At the time I was persuing a degree in Electrical 
                Engineering and one of the earlier required classes was an Intro to Programming
                course where we learned Java. That was my first introduction into coding and it
                was one of the only classes I've taken that I can honestly say I've been engrossed
                in and thouroghly enjoyed. I kept tinkering around with coding on and off since
                then but with no real focus and only with the Java language. This first week has 
                proven to me that this course will be fast paced but I think it's going to be very
                enjoyable.
